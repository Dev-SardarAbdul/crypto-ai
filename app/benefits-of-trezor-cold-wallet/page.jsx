        What is a Trezor Cold Wallet?
      </h2>

      <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-white md:text-base font-extralight ">
        Trezor Cold Wallet is a hardware wallet designed to provide secure
        offline storage for various cryptocurrencies. Unlike hot wallets, which
        are connected to the internet and susceptible to online threats, cold
        wallets like Trezor store your private keys offline, thereby offering
        enhanced security against hacking, phishing, and other online
        vulnerabilities.
